      Microchip Technology Inc. (was: Atmel Corporation) had a series of cool cryptographic chips.
      They were extremely useful for adding encryption and authentication to microcontrollers,
      and they were probably one of the only chips on the market that came with full datasheets
      and specifications without an NDA. Other similar crypto chips are all behind the closed doors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It was true for Microchip's <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATECC508A">
      ATECC508A</a> crypto chips, all datasheets are on the official website, no question is
      asked.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Unfortunately, for its successor, <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATECC608A">
      ATECC608A</a>, Microchip refused to continue publishing full datasheet as it did in the past.
      Full datasheet is only available after signing an NDA. Even worse, now ATECC508A is
      <em>Not Recommended For New Design</em> anymore, which means ATECC508A will eventually be
      discontinued and completely replaced by the undocumented ATECC608A soon.
